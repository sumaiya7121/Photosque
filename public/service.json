    "description": "One of the most common photography styles, portrait photography, or portraiture, aims to capture the personality and mood of an individual or group. Images may be candid or posed, full body or close-ups. Either way, the subject’s face and eyes are typically in focus. Lighting and backdrop help to convey tone and emotion. Popular types of photography portraits include senior portraits, family portraits, engagement photos, and professional headshots. The best portrait photographers make clients feel completely comfortable, so that their expressions are natural and relaxed.",

    "description": "One of the most important events in many people’s lives is a wedding, and that means wedding photographers have a huge responsibility. Not only do wedding photographers need to have good camera and lighting skills, but they also must know how to work with people and capture the right emotions almost effortlessly. This is a difficult type of photography to practice, and you only get one chance to do it right, so I have a lot of respect for good wedding photographers.",

    "description": "Documentary photographers seek to convey news or information in their images. Sometimes, the photos depict a moment so striking that it crosses the line into art or otherwise causes viewers to have an emotional reaction. Documentary photography can happen anywhere, from local news stories to reporting directly from war zones. In the best of cases, documentary photos shed light on important yet little-known events, or celebrate the best examples of humanity for everyone to see. Not all documentary photos are newsworthy; sometimes, they simply document a different place or culture.",

    "description": "Aside from weddings, there are broader classes of events that deserve recognition as a separate genre of photography. For example, corporate events, concerts, parades, and other celebrations all count as event photography. You can expect unpredictability and fast-paced scenes – but also interesting human interactions and sometimes (like with concert photos) very good light. Skilled event photographers are able to convey emotions so that viewers are able to relive the moment.",

    "description": "Commercial photography of people is anything intended to sell a product, especially advertisements and even stock photos. Commercial photographers often simply capture the products themselves, although that’s something I’ll cover later in this article; people are still used very frequently in advertising campaigns today. Usually, the goal of commercial photography is to create images that match the emotions and message the brand in question is trying to convey. These photographers need special skills in studio lighting and visualization to make the client’s plan a reality.",
